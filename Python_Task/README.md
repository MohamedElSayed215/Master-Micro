# Function Plotter

A Python GUI application built with **PySide6** and **Matplotlib** that allows users to input two mathematical functions of `x`, plot them, and find their intersection points.

---

## Features

- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the user inputs valid mathematical functions.
- **Supported Operators**: `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `^` (exponentiation), `log10()`, and `sqrt()`.
- **Plotting**: Plots the two functions on a graph.
- **Intersection Points**: Finds and annotates the intersection points of the two functions.
- **Automated Tests**: Includes `pytest` and `pytest-qt` tests for input validation and plotting functionality.
